While the idea of IoT has been in existence for a long time, a collection of recent advances in a number of different technologies has made it practical.

Access to low-cost, low-power sensor technology. Affordable and reliable sensors are making IoT technology possible for more manufacturers.

Connectivity. A host of network protocols for the internet has made it easy to connect sensors to the cloud and to other “things” for efficient data transfer.
